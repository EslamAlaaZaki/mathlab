## Introduction        
Mathematical library software . Similar to Matlab, Octave and similar tools

## Specifications
* Using C/C++
* Development under linux
* Production to linux server (Centos 6.7)
* Any C/C++ IDE works under linux.
* g++ compiler, makefile is required.
* Source Control, Issue Tracking, Documents at Bitbucket

## Phases
1. Core operations (3 Weeks)
2. Advanced Operations and Tuning (3 Weeks)
3. Advanced system operations (4 Weeks after exams)

### Phase 1: Core Operations

#### Description:

* Implement C++ class for matrix .
* Support dynamic creation and destruction of matrices of any size .
* Support addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose and division .
* Process input user commands and show results directly .
* Process input file, show each step result then exit.

#### Code: 

```c++
A = [1.4 2.2 3.2; 4.4 5.4 6.4; 3.3 4.2 2.2];
B = [1.5 4.1 5.4; 3.1 4.2 1.2; 3.2 4.3 2.2];
C = A + B ;
D = A - B ;
E = A * B ;
F = A / B ;
G = A’ ;
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Operations &upgrading and Tuning 

#### Description
- upport mathematical functions. 
  - Trigonometric, Logarithmic, Roots, Power
- Support mathematical expressions.
  - Either with (dot) or not.
- Support flexible matrix parser.
  - Accept matrix in matrix, expressions and variables 
- Support error handling.
  - Do not crash for invalid input.


#### Code:

```c++
A = 5.5 + 12 * sin(0.4) + 2.2^4;
B = [1.2 2.3 A;[1.3 2.4;4.6 1.3],[3.2;7.8]];
C = [[B [3.4; 2.1; 3.5+9.1]] 1.2^3 3+1.2 15/(2.1+10*sin(0.12))  1.2];
D = rand(4,4);
E = eye(4, 4);
F = zeros(2, 3);
G = ones(3, 6);
L = (1.2 + 3.4 - 5.6)/(2.1*3.2 + 4.6) - 12.1*3.1 + (1.2 + 5.2)^(4/(3.2+5.6));
X = ((C*D .+ 4)./2.1 + sqrt(D))./C.^2;
Y = (C^3 * sin(1./D))^(0.1);
```
